# Home Automation

As someone who has leaned into the world of smart devices, I have found it frustrating to have an app for every appliance. Limiting control to just my phone means others can't exercise control and if I lose my phone it's all over. My goal is to create a solution that solves these issues (while providing some extra fetures along the way).

This is largely meant to be a learning opportunity for me. The solution will be specific for my use cases, but feel free to take what works for you.
